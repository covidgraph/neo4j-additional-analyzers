# additional full text analyzers for Neo4j

The graph database https://www.neo4j.com[Neo4j] does support fulltext indexing out of the box. Part of this is fine grained configuration of analzyers for each index. There's a good write up how to build your own custom analyzers.
This project leverages couple of commonly used analyzers.

## Installation

The analyzers are supposed to work with Neo4j >= 3.4. Clone this repo and use https://www.maven.org[Maven] to build a jar file:

[source,shell]
----
mvn package
cp target/neo4j-additional-analyzers-<version>.jar <NEO4J_HOME>/plugins
----

and restart Neo4j.
