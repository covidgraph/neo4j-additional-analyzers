# additional full text analyzers for Neo4j

The graph database https://www.neo4j.com[Neo4j] does support fulltext indexing out of the box. Part of this is fine grained configuration of analzyers for each index. There's a good write up how to build your own custom analyzers.
This project leverages couple of commonly used analyzers.

## Installation

The analyzers are supposed to work with Neo4j >= 3.4. Clone this repo and use https://www.maven.org[Maven] to build a jar file:

[source,shell]
----
mvn package
cp target/neo4j-additional-analyzers-<version>.jar <NEO4J_HOME>/plugins
----

and restart Neo4j.

## Usage

Set up a fulltext index and specificy the custom index:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.index.fulltext.createNodeIndex("myindex", ["Articles"], ["abstract", "content"], {analyzers: "whitespace_lower"});
CALL db.index.fulltext.createNodeIndex("myindex", ["Articles"], ["abstract", "content"], {analyzers: "synonym"});
----

## Reference of available analzyers

### whitespace_lower

This analyzer combines the `whitespace` analyzer with German and English stopword lists and applies a toLower conversion as well.
Due to usage of `whitespace` terms containing dashes, e.g. `PNAS-108` as gene symbol or technical terms like `x-270Â°C` are treated as one atomic term.

### synonym

Synonym analyzer is aware of gene symbols containing whitespace, e.g. `cGK 1`. Those multi-word terms will be mapping to a single word alternative using Lucene's `SynonymFilterFactory`. Aside of this mapping, the `synonym` analyzer works exactly like `whitespace_lower`
